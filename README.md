# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Resources
#### Data Sources: 
* tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js
* index.html
#### Data Tools: 
* JavaScript
* JSON, GeoJSON
* IO (Web Server)
#### Software: 
* ES6+
* ECMAScript
* Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. I will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
* Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
* Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

# Deliverable 1 Requirements: 
* The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group
* The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object
* The d3.json() callback is working and does the following:
  * The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer
  * The geoJSON() layer adds color and width to the tectonic plate lines
  * The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map
* The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displays on the map when the page loads

# Deliverable 2 Requirements:
* The major earthquake data is added as a third layer group
* The major earthquake data is added to the overlay object
* The d3.json() callback is working and does the following:
  * Sets the color and diameter of each earthquake.
  * The major earthquake data is passed to the geoJSON() layer.
  * The geoJSON() layer creates a circle for each major earthquake, and adds a popup for each circle to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake
  * The major earthquake layer group variable is added to the map
* All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off

# Deliverable 3 Requirements:
* A third map tile layer is created
* The third map is added to the overlay object
* All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the all maps of the webpage
